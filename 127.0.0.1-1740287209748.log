Web applications can range from simple static web pages to complex, dynamic applications that interact with databases and other services. They are a crucial component of modern business infrastructure, enabling everything from e-commerce to data analysis to collaboration. However, they also present significant security challenges. These include potential vulnerabilities in the application code, user authentication mechanisms, and data handling practices. Threat vectors can range from injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), to session hijacking. Security considerations include the configuration of access controls, encryption of sensitive data, and the security of the server on which the web application is hosted."capability_group: "Applications & Workloads"capability_id: "Web Application"comments: "While the Scheduled Task technique does not directly target web applications, it can be abused in scenarios where a web application server runs on a Windows operating system.
